// ============== QUESTION PROMPT ===============
Remember your Week 0 Assignment when you printed your name using printf()
 with hashes? Here's an extension to that assignment.
 
 You are given your final solution to the problem - but implement the
 program with the following characteristics:
 
 Upon running the program, ask the user to enter an integer between
 0 and 7 (both inclusive). For the integer i between 0 and 7, print out
 the first i characters of your name (instead of the full name).

// =============================================

 #include <stdio.h>
int main (void)
{
    // Your starter code for the assignment is as follows - this is just the Code you wrote in Week 0 :)
    // MODIFY YOUR IMPLEMENTATION BELOW!
    //1st row
    printf("#       #    ############          #        #       #        ######    #        ####### \n");
    //2nd row
    printf("  #   #            #             #   #      # #     #      #           #        #       \n");
    //3rd row
    printf("    #              #            #######     #   #   #      #     ###   #        #####   \n");
    //4th row
    printf("  #   #            #           #       #    #     # #      #      #    #        #       \n");
    //5th row
    printf("#       #    ############     #         #   #       #      ########    ######   ####### \n");
